Catan Online
This is a personal project to create an online version of Catan. This git is currently only the back end code.

FAQ:
1. Where should I start with contributing to this project?
You should familiarize yourself with the model. Essentially there are 3 components, Grid, Game, and Player.

A diagram of the components of the model: https://drive.google.com/a/sduhsd.net/file/d/1kQRi8capoak7-0EoLtPama4fO2MQUM-R/view?usp=drivesdk
After that, I would greatly appreciate it if you can write some tests/debugging for that model.
After that, maybe help me with the socket file.
